### Question: You need to complete 2 tasks. 


### Task 1. You need to install 4 roles from `Ansible Galaxy` and these roles must be in the file `/home/student/ansible/my-roles/role-from-galaxy.yaml`
- Download the file `https://github.com/anishrana2001/Openshift/raw/refs/heads/main/RHCE/V-9.0/Role_zabbix-1.0.6.tar.gz` and name it `zabbix-anish`
- Download the file `https://galaxy.ansible.com/download/openafs_contrib-openafs-1.9.0.tar.gz` and name it `openafs-devops-wala`
- Download the file `https://github.com/anishrana2001/Openshift/raw/refs/heads/main/RHCE/V-9.0/Role_ansible-squid-0.1.2.tar.gz` and name it `squid-anish`
- Download the file `https://github.com/anishrana2001/Openshift/raw/refs/heads/main/RHCE/V-9.0/phpinfo.tar.gz` and name it `phpinfo`

### Task 2. Create a playbook called `/home/student/ansible/ansible-galaxy-role1.yaml`
 1. The playbook contains a play which run on `lab` host group and use the role `phpinfo`
 
   A PHP server (specifically a web server configured with a PHP interpreter) is used to execute server-side scripts for creating dynamic, data-driven, and interactive web applications. It processes PHP code on the server and sends the resulting HTML content to the client's web browse

 2. This playbook must contain a play which run on `webserver` host group and use the role `phpinfo`
 3. This playbook also contains a play which run on `webserver` host group and use the role `squid-anish`
 
    A Squid server is a free, open-source caching and forwarding web proxy, primarily used to improve network performance by storing frequently accessed web content locally. 

    It speeds up response times and reduces bandwidth by serving cached copies of web pages, images, and other data to multiple users. Squid also acts as a security tool by filtering traffic and can be configured for load balancing

- src: https://github.com/anishrana2001/Openshift/raw/refs/heads/main/RHCE/V-9.0/Role_zabbix-1.0.6.tar.gz
  name: zabbix-anish
- src: https://galaxy.ansible.com/download/openafs_contrib-openafs-1.9.0.tar.gz
  name: openafs-devops-wala
- src: https://github.com/anishrana2001/Openshift/raw/refs/heads/main/RHCE/V-9.0/Role_ansible-squid-0.1.2.tar.gz
  name: squid-anish
- src: https://github.com/anishrana2001/Openshift/raw/refs/heads/main/RHCE/V-9.0/phpinfo.tar.gz

```

### Install the role from galaxy.
```
ansible-galaxy install -r /home/student/ansible/my-roles/role-from-galaxy.yaml -p /home/student/ansible/my-roles/
```

### Perform the Post checks.

```
ansible-galaxy role list | head
```


## Task 2: 

#### We just need to add 2 roles in the given file.

```
vim /home/student/ansible/ansible-galaxy-role1.yaml
```
```
---
- name: Install zabbix-anish role
  hosts: lab
  roles: 
    - phpinfo

- name: Install squid-anish role
  hosts: webserver
