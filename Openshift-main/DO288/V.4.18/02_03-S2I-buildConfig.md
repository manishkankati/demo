## 🧪 How to Prepare the Lab

Run these commands on the workstation as the `student` user. They download the
practice repository, initialize it as a Git repository, and push it to the lab
Git server.

> [!NOTE]
> Use these preparation commands on a fresh lab environment. Do not change the
> application files before attempting the task.


Start the lab:

```bash
lab start deploy-introduction
oc login -u developer -p developer https://api.ocp4.example.com:6443
oc new-project deploy-si
echo "This is the First Page" > /tmp/index.html
echo "This is the First Page" > /tmp/devopswala.html

```

# Q2 — Build and Deploy `todo-app2` on OpenShift

## Question: You are a developer working on an OpenShift cluster.

- The application must be built and deployed from the source code at: `https://git.ocp4.example.com/developer/DO288-apps`
- The application source code is located in the subdirectory: `labs/builds-s2i/s2i-scripts `
- The application must be deployed to the project `deploy-si`
- The deployed application and its resources must be named `todo-app2`
- The build **must modify the existing S2I scripts** of the `httpd:2.4-ubi9` builder image to set the `SERVER_PORT` **environment variable** with the value `8081`
- During the **build of the image**, as part of the assemble script, /tmp/*.html files are copied into ./

- The application must be accessible using both:
    - http://todo-app2.apps.ocp4.example.com
    - https://todo-app2.apps.ocp4.example.com
- When web page open, it should displays date when the application was built (YYYY-mm-dd format) as well as the text `You have completed this task`

| Requirement | Required Value |
|---|---|
| 📁 Project | `deploy-si` |
| 📦 Application/resource name | `todo-app2` |
| 🔗 Git repository | `https://git.ocp4.example.com/developer/DO288-apps` |

# 🧠 Understand What the Question Is Testing

The question is testing several OpenShift skills at once:

```text
Git source
   │
   ▼
Context directory
   │
   ▼
S2I builder: openshift/httpd:2.4-ubi9
   │
   ▼
Custom .s2i/bin/run
   │
   ├── existing httpd setup
   └── export SERVER_PORT=8081
   │
   ▼
BuildConfig
   │
   ▼
ImageStream: todo-app2
   │
   ▼
Deployment: todo-app2
   │
   ▼
Service: todo-app2
   │
   ▼
Route: todo-app2
   ├── HTTP
   └── HTTPS
```

### ❓ Why not just use `--build-env=SERVER_PORT=8081`?

This command:

```bash
--build-env=SERVER_PORT=8081
```

would place the variable in the BuildConfig approximately as:

```yaml
spec:
  strategy:
    sourceStrategy:
      env:
      - name: SERVER_PORT
        value: "8081"
```

That makes the variable available to the S2I build environment, but it does **not modify the provided S2I script**.

The requirement explicitly says:

> **The build must modify the existing S2I scripts.**

Therefore, for this lab, modify:

```text
labs/builds-s2i/s2i-scripts/.s2i/bin/run
```

and add:

```bash
export SERVER_PORT=8081
```

---

# ✅ Step 1 — Select and Verify the Project

Select the required project:

```bash
oc project deploy-si
```

Verify the project exists:

```bash
oc get project deploy-si
```

Check the default service accounts:

```bash
oc get sa
```

Typical output:

```text
NAME       SECRETS   AGE
builder    1         ...
default    1         ...
deployer   1         ...
pipeline   1         ...
```

Inspect the `builder` service account:

```bash
oc describe sa builder
```

You should confirm:

```text
Name:        builder
Namespace:   deploy-si
```

> [!NOTE]
> OpenShift builds normally use the `builder` ServiceAccount unless another service account is explicitly configured.

---

# 🖼️ Step 2 — Inspect the Required Builder Image

The task requires:

```text
httpd:2.4-ubi9
```

Check that the ImageStreamTag exists:

```bash
oc get istag httpd:2.4-ubi9 -n openshift
```

Inspect it in detail:

```bash
oc describe istag httpd:2.4-ubi9 -n openshift
```

Look for these important values:

```text
io.openshift.s2i.scripts-url=image:///usr/libexec/s2i
io.s2i.scripts-url=image:///usr/libexec/s2i
STI_SCRIPTS_PATH=/usr/libexec/s2i
HTTPD_CONTAINER_SCRIPTS_PATH=/usr/share/container-scripts/httpd/
Exposes Ports: 8080/tcp, 8443/tcp
```

### 🧠 What does this tell us?

The builder's original embedded S2I scripts are located at:

```text
/usr/libexec/s2i
```

Typical S2I scripts include:

```text
/usr/libexec/s2i/assemble
/usr/libexec/s2i/run
/usr/libexec/s2i/save-artifacts
```

The source repository may override these scripts by providing files under:

```text
.s2i/bin/
```

For this lab, an existing custom `run` script is already provided.

---

# 🔐 Step 3 — Check Cross-Project Image Pull Permission

Your build runs in:

```text
deploy-si
```

but the builder ImageStreamTag is in:

```text
openshift
```

That is cross-project image access.

### 3.1 Check whether you can manage RoleBindings

```bash
oc auth can-i create rolebindings -n openshift
```

```bash
oc auth can-i update rolebindings -n openshift
```

Expected in the lab environment:

```text
yes
```

### 3.2 Check whether `deploy-si:builder` can pull image layers

```bash
oc auth can-i get imagestreams/layers \
  --as=system:serviceaccount:deploy-si:builder \
  -n openshift
```

If the result is:

```text
yes
```

the permission already exists.

If the result is:

```text
no
```

grant the permission:

```bash
oc policy add-role-to-user \
  system:image-puller \
  system:serviceaccount:deploy-si:builder \
  --namespace=openshift
```

Verify again:

```bash
oc auth can-i get imagestreams/layers \
  --as=system:serviceaccount:deploy-si:builder \
  -n openshift
```

Expected:

```text
yes
```

---

# 🧩 Step 4 — Understand `system:image-puller`

Check the built-in ClusterRole:

```bash
oc get clusterrole system:image-puller
```

Describe it:

```bash
oc describe clusterrole system:image-puller
```

The important permission is:

```text
Resources: imagestreams/layers
Verbs:     get
```

### 🔍 Command syntax

General syntax:

```bash
oc policy add-role-to-user <ROLE> <USER-OR-SA> --namespace=<TARGET_NAMESPACE>
```

For a ServiceAccount:

```bash
oc policy add-role-to-user <ROLE> \
  system:serviceaccount:<SA_NAMESPACE>:<SERVICE_ACCOUNT> \
  --namespace=<RESOURCE_NAMESPACE>
```

Your command:

```bash
oc policy add-role-to-user system:image-puller \
  system:serviceaccount:deploy-si:builder \
  --namespace=openshift
```

means:

```text
system:image-puller
        │
        └── ClusterRole being granted

system:serviceaccount:deploy-si:builder
                      │         │
                      │         └── ServiceAccount
                      └──────────── namespace where SA lives

--namespace=openshift
            │
            └── namespace containing the protected images
```

---

## 🤔 What about the existing `system:image-pullers` RoleBinding?

You may already see:

```bash
oc get rolebinding -n openshift
```

with:

```text
system:image-pullers    ClusterRole/system:image-puller
```

Inspect it:

```bash
oc get rolebinding system:image-pullers -n openshift -o yaml
```

It normally contains:

```yaml
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: system:serviceaccounts:openshift
```

That means:

> All ServiceAccounts **inside the `openshift` namespace** can pull images from `openshift`.

It does **not** automatically include:

```text
system:serviceaccount:deploy-si:builder
```

because `builder` belongs to `deploy-si`.

Therefore a separate cross-project RoleBinding is valid.

### ⚠️ Do not casually edit `system:image-pullers`

Its annotation normally states that it is auto-managed by OpenShift.

Leave the platform-managed RoleBinding alone and grant the required external ServiceAccount its own access.

---

# 📥 Step 5 — Clone and Inspect the Source Repository

Move to your home directory:

```bash
cd ~
```

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://git.ocp4.example.com/developer/DO288-apps
```

Enter the repository:

```bash
cd DO288-apps
```

Inspect the application directory:

```bash
ls -la labs/builds-s2i/s2i-scripts
```

Inspect the custom S2I scripts:

```bash
ls -la labs/builds-s2i/s2i-scripts/.s2i/bin
```

View the existing `run` script:

```bash
cat labs/builds-s2i/s2i-scripts/.s2i/bin/run
```

Before modification, it may look similar to:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

source ${HTTPD_CONTAINER_SCRIPTS_PATH}/common.sh

export HTTPD_RUN_BY_S2I=1

# Make Apache show 'debug' level logs during start up
exec run-httpd -e debug $@
```

---

# 🛠️ Step 6 — Modify the Existing S2I `run` Script

Edit:

```bash
vi labs/builds-s2i/s2i-scripts/.s2i/bin/run
```

Add:

```bash
export SERVER_PORT=8081
cp -Rf /tmp/*.html ./
DATE=$(date "+%F")
echo "$DATE" >> ./index.html
echo "You have completed this task" >> ./index.html
```

The completed file should be:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

source ${HTTPD_CONTAINER_SCRIPTS_PATH}/common.sh

export HTTPD_RUN_BY_S2I=1
export SERVER_PORT=8081

cp -Rf /tmp/*.html ./
DATE=$(date "+%F")
echo "$DATE" >> ./index.html
echo "You have completed this task" >> ./index.html

# Make Apache show 'debug' level logs during start up
exec run-httpd -e debug $@
```

Verify:

```bash
cat labs/builds-s2i/s2i-scripts/.s2i/bin/run
```

### ✅ Quick verification

```bash
grep SERVER_PORT labs/builds-s2i/s2i-scripts/.s2i/bin/run
```

Expected:

```text
export SERVER_PORT=8081
```

Check executable permissions:

```bash
ls -l labs/builds-s2i/s2i-scripts/.s2i/bin/run
```

If required:

```bash
chmod +x labs/builds-s2i/s2i-scripts/.s2i/bin/run
```

---

## 🧠 Why is this the correct solution?

The script already contains the existing HTTPD S2I startup logic:

```bash
source ${HTTPD_CONTAINER_SCRIPTS_PATH}/common.sh
export HTTPD_RUN_BY_S2I=1
exec run-httpd -e debug $@
```

You are not replacing this behavior with something unrelated.

You are adding:

```bash
export SERVER_PORT=8081
```

before Apache is launched.

Because `SERVER_PORT` is exported, the process started by:

```bash
exec run-httpd ...
```

inherits the variable.

> [!TIP]
> In production shell scripts, `"$@"` is safer than `$@`.  
> For this lab, however, avoid unnecessary changes to the supplied script unless the task requires them.

---

# 📤 Step 7 — Commit and Push the S2I Change

OpenShift builds from the **remote Git repository**, not from the copy sitting on your workstation.

If you edit locally but do not push, the build will happily clone the old code and ignore your masterpiece.

Check your change:

```bash
git status
```

```bash
git diff
```

You should see approximately:

```diff
 export HTTPD_RUN_BY_S2I=1
+export SERVER_PORT=8081

cp -Rf /tmp/*.html ./
DATE=$(date "+%F")
echo "$DATE" >> ./index.html
echo "You have completed this task" >> ./index.html
```

Stage the modified file:

```bash
git add labs/builds-s2i/s2i-scripts/.s2i/bin/run
```

Commit:

```bash
git commit -m "Set SERVER_PORT in S2I run script"
```

Push:

```bash
git push
```

Verify:

```bash
git status
```

Ideally:

```text
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

---

# 🔑 Step 8 — Create the Git Source Secret

The task explicitly says:

> **The Git credentials must be stored as a Secret and made available to the build process.**

Do not put a username/password directly into the Git URL.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the Git credentials supplied by your lab.  
> Do **not** automatically assume that the OpenShift login (`developer/developer`) is also the Git credential unless the lab explicitly says so.

### 8.1 Create a Basic Authentication Secret

Example syntax:

```bash
oc create secret generic todo-app2-git \
  --type=kubernetes.io/basic-auth \
  --from-literal=username=developer \
  --from-literal=password=d3v3lop3r
```

Verify:

```bash
oc get secret todo-app2-git
```

You can inspect metadata safely with:

```bash
oc describe secret todo-app2-git
```

Do not print secret values unnecessarily.

---

# 🏗️ Step 9 — Build and Deploy `todo-app2`

Because the source secret already exists, pass it directly to `oc new-app`:

```bash
oc new-app \
  openshift/httpd:2.4-ubi9~https://git.ocp4.example.com/developer/DO288-apps \
  --context-dir=labs/builds-s2i/s2i-scripts \
  --source-secret=todo-app2-git \
  --name=todo-app2 \
  --strategy=source \
  -n deploy-si
```

### 🧩 Break down the command

```text
openshift/httpd:2.4-ubi9
│         │     │
│         │     └── tag
│         └──────── ImageStream
└────────────────── namespace containing builder
```

The `~` connects:

```text
builder image ~ source repository
```

So:

```text
openshift/httpd:2.4-ubi9
             ~
https://git.ocp4.example.com/developer/DO288-apps
```

means:

> Build this Git source using this S2I builder.

The context directory:

```bash
--context-dir=labs/builds-s2i/s2i-scripts
```

tells OpenShift where the actual application is located inside the repository.

The name:

```bash
--name=todo-app2
```

ensures the generated application resources use the required name.

The source secret:

```bash
--source-secret=todo-app2-git
```

makes the Git credentials available to the BuildConfig for source cloning.

---

## 🔄 If `todo-app2` already exists

If you created the app before attaching the source secret, attach it afterward:

```bash
oc set build-secret --source bc/todo-app2 todo-app2-git
```

Then start a fresh build:

```bash
oc start-build todo-app2 --follow
```

Verify the secret reference:

```bash
oc get bc todo-app2 \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.source.sourceSecret.name}{"\n"}'
```

Expected:

```text
todo-app2-git
```

---

# 🔎 Step 10 — Verify the BuildConfig

Check:

```bash
oc get bc todo-app2
```

Typical output:

```text
NAME        TYPE     FROM   LATEST
todo-app2   Source   Git    1
```

---

## 10.1 Verify Git repository

```bash
oc get bc todo-app2 \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.source.git.uri}{"\n"}'
```

Expected:

```text
https://git.ocp4.example.com/developer/DO288-apps
```

---

## 10.2 Verify context directory

```bash
oc get bc todo-app2 \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.source.contextDir}{"\n"}'
```

Expected:

```text
labs/builds-s2i/s2i-scripts
```

---

## 10.3 Verify source secret

```bash
oc get bc todo-app2 \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.source.sourceSecret.name}{"\n"}'
```

Expected:

```text
todo-app2-git
```

---

## 10.4 Verify builder ImageStreamTag

```bash
oc get bc todo-app2 \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.strategy.sourceStrategy.from.namespace}/{.spec.strategy.sourceStrategy.from.name}{"\n"}'
```

Expected:

```text
openshift/httpd:2.4-ubi9
```

---

## 10.5 Why `SERVER_PORT` may NOT appear in the BuildConfig

Do not expect this to return anything:

```bash
oc get bc todo-app2 -o yaml | grep SERVER_PORT
```

That is normal for **this solution**.

You did not configure:

```yaml
sourceStrategy:
  env:
```

Instead, you modified:

```text
.s2i/bin/run
```

with:

```bash
export SERVER_PORT=8081
```

### Remember

```text
SERVER_PORT=8081
      │
      └── check .s2i/bin/run

Builder/Git/context/sourceSecret
      │
      └── check BuildConfig
```

---

# 📦 Step 11 — Verify the Build and Pod

Check builds:

```bash
oc get builds
```

Expected:

```text
NAME          TYPE     FROM          STATUS
todo-app2-1   Source   Git@...       Complete
```

Follow build logs if needed:

```bash
oc logs -f bc/todo-app2
```

Check pods:

```bash
oc get pods
```

Typical result:

```text
NAME                         READY   STATUS      RESTARTS
todo-app2-1-build            0/1     Completed   0
todo-app2-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx   1/1     Running     0
```

Check all generated resources:

```bash
oc get all
```

You should normally see resources associated with:

```text
todo-app2
```

including the build, ImageStream, Deployment, Pod and Service.

---

# 🌐 Step 12 — Configure HTTP and HTTPS Access

The required hostname is:

```text
todo-app2.apps.ocp4.example.com
```

The application must work with both:

```text
http://todo-app2.apps.ocp4.example.com
https://todo-app2.apps.ocp4.example.com
```

Create an **edge TLS route** and allow insecure HTTP traffic:

```bash
oc create route edge todo-app2 \
  --service=todo-app2 \
  --hostname=todo-app2.apps.ocp4.example.com \
  --insecure-policy=Allow
```

### 🧠 Why `Allow`?

With edge TLS termination:

```text
Client --HTTPS--> OpenShift Router --HTTP--> Service/Pod
```

Setting:

```text
insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Allow
```

also permits HTTP requests rather than disabling or redirecting them.

Therefore the same route can satisfy:

```text
HTTP  ✅
HTTPS ✅
```

---

## 12.1 Verify the route

```bash
oc get route todo-app2
```

Check hostname:

```bash
oc get route todo-app2 \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
```

Expected:

```text
todo-app2.apps.ocp4.example.com
```

Check TLS termination and HTTP policy:

```bash
oc get route todo-app2 \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.tls.termination}{" "}{.spec.tls.insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy}{"\n"}'
```

Expected:

```text
edge Allow
```

---

## 12.2 Test HTTP

```bash
curl -I http://todo-app2.apps.ocp4.example.com
```

---

## 12.3 Test HTTPS

In a lab using a non-public or wildcard training certificate, you may need:

```bash
curl -k -I https://todo-app2.apps.ocp4.example.com
```

> [!NOTE]
> `-k` tells curl not to reject an untrusted training certificate.  
> It is useful for a controlled lab, not a habit to copy into production automation.

---

# 🧪 Step 13 — Verify `SERVER_PORT=8081`

There are **two levels of verification**.

---

## ✅ 13.1 Easiest source-level check

This is the simplest and most exam-friendly verification:

```bash
grep SERVER_PORT labs/builds-s2i/s2i-scripts/.s2i/bin/run
```

Expected:

```text
export SERVER_PORT=8081
```

This proves that you made the required S2I script modification.

---

## ✅ 13.2 Runtime verification

Because the variable is exported by the startup script, a plain:

```bash
oc exec <pod> -- printenv | grep SERVER
```

may return nothing.

That command starts a new exec process whose environment comes from the container configuration; it is not the best way to prove an environment variable that was exported later by the startup script.

A shorter runtime check is:

```bash
oc exec deploy/todo-app2 -- \
  grep -ao 'SERVER_PORT=8081' /proc/1/environ
```

Expected:

```text
SERVER_PORT=8081
```

This checks the environment of the application's main process.

---

# 💡 About the `npm_config_registry` Hint

The question includes a hint:

> The npm dependency repository can be passed to the build environment using `npm_config_registry`.

For this specific `httpd` S2I exercise, do **not** blindly add an npm registry unless the application actually needs npm dependencies or the lab gives you a registry URL.

If a task explicitly provides an npm registry value, that is a **build environment variable**, for example:

```bash
oc set env bc/todo-app2 \
  npm_config_registry='<NPM_REGISTRY_URL>'
```

or it could be supplied while creating the app with the appropriate build-environment option.

This is different from the `SERVER_PORT` requirement.

```text
npm_config_registry
      │
      └── Build environment setting

SERVER_PORT=8081
      │
      └── Required modification inside .s2i/bin/run
```

Do not mix the two concepts merely because both happen to be environment variables. OpenShift already supplies enough nouns without us helping it create new confusion.

  -o jsonpath='{.spec.source.git.uri}{"\n"}'
```

```bash
oc get bc todo-app2 \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.source.contextDir}{"\n"}'
```

```bash
oc get bc todo-app2 \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.source.sourceSecret.name}{"\n"}'
```

```bash
oc get bc todo-app2 \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.strategy.sourceStrategy.from.namespace}/{.spec.strategy.sourceStrategy.from.name}{"\n"}'
```

Expected:

```text
https://git.ocp4.example.com/developer/DO288-apps
labs/builds-s2i/s2i-scripts
todo-app2-git
openshift/httpd:2.4-ubi9
```

## 9️⃣ Verify build/application

```bash
oc get builds
oc get pods
oc get all
```

Expected:

```text
Build: Complete
Pod:   Running
```

---

## 🔟 Create route

```bash
oc create route edge todo-app2 \
  --service=todo-app2 \
  --hostname=todo-app2.apps.ocp4.example.com \
  --insecure-policy=Allow
```

Verify:

```bash
oc get route todo-app2
```

```bash
oc get route todo-app2 \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.tls.termination}{" "}{.spec.tls.insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy}{"\n"}'
```

Expected:

```text
edge Allow
```

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Test both URLs

```bash
curl -I http://todo-app2.apps.ocp4.example.com
```

```bash
curl -k -I https://todo-app2.apps.ocp4.example.com
```

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Verify S2I requirement

Fast source check:

```bash
grep SERVER_PORT labs/builds-s2i/s2i-scripts/.s2i/bin/run
```

Expected:

```text
export SERVER_PORT=8081
```

Optional runtime proof:

```bash
oc exec deploy/todo-app2 -- \
  grep -ao 'SERVER_PORT=8081' /proc/1/environ
```

Expected:

```text
SERVER_PORT=8081
```

> ## 🎓 Instructor Takeaway
>
> The main lesson is not merely “how to deploy an httpd application.”  
> The task teaches you to separate **five different configuration layers**:
>
> 1. **RBAC** — Can the build ServiceAccount access the builder image?
> 2. **S2I customization** — What must the builder/runtime script do differently?
> 3. **Build source** — Which Git repo, context directory, and credentials are used?
> 4. **Build/deployment resources** — Are the correct image and resource names created?
> 5. **Networking** — Is the application exposed exactly as requested over HTTP and HTTPS?
>
> Once you learn to identify which layer owns each requirement, EX288 questions become much less mysterious. OpenShift itself remains fond of having six objects for what humans casually call “the app,” but at least now you know which one to inspect.
