# 🚀 EX288 V4.14 - OpenShift Application Developer Complete Flow Guide

## From Developer Code to Running Application + Tekton CI/CD

```
---

# 🎯 Learning Goal

By the end of this guide, a developer should understand:



## How does my source code become a running application in OpenShift?

### How does OpenShift create:
- Image
- Container
- Deployment
- Service
- Route

## How do triggers automate deployment?

## Why do we use Tekton Pipelines?

# 1. Developer Creates Application


Example:



developer/
|
|
+--- app/
|
+--- package.json
|
+--- index.js
|
+--- Dockerfile
|
+--- README.md




Developer pushes code:


```

git add .

git commit -m "new application"

git push origin main

```


Result:


```

GitLab Repository

```
    |
    |
    v
```

OpenShift can access source code

```


---

# 2. Builder Image Concept


## What is Builder Image?


Builder Image is a pre-created environment containing:


```

Compiler
Libraries
Runtime
Build Tools

```


Example:


| Application | Builder Image |
|-|-|
| Node.js | nodejs builder |
| Java | openjdk builder |
| Python | python builder |
| .NET | dotnet builder |


Example:


```

Source Code

```
  +
```

Builder Image

```
  |

  v
```

Application Container Image

```

# 3. OpenShift Build Process


## Build Flow


```

```
    Git Repository

          |
          |
          v


    BuildConfig


          |
          |
          v


    Source-To-Image (S2I)


          |
          |
          v


   Builder Container


          |
          |
          v


   Container Image


          |
          |
          v


   ImageStream
```

```


---

# 4. Important OpenShift Build Objects


## BuildConfig


Think:

> Recipe for creating an image


Example:


```

BuildConfig

Contains:

* Source location
* Builder image
* Build strategy
* Output image

```


---

## ImageStream


Think:

> Image version manager


Example:


```

ImageStream

my-app

Tags:

latest

v1

v2

```


ImageStream tracks:

```

Where image exists

What version is running

When image changes

````


---

# 5. How "oc new-app" Creates Resources


The magic command:


```bash

oc new-app

````

is a developer shortcut.

Example:

```bash

oc new-app nodejs~https://gitlab.com/myapp.git


```

OpenShift automatically creates:

```

             oc new-app


                 |
                 |
                 v


       +----------------+

       BuildConfig

       +----------------+

       ImageStream

                 |

                 v

       +----------------+


                 |

                 v


       +----------------+

       Service

       +----------------+


                 |

                 v


       +----------------+

       Route

       +----------------+

# 6. Resources Created by oc new-app

## Deployment

Responsible for:

```
- Running Pods
- Scaling
- Updating versions

```

---

## Pod

Actual application container.

```

# 7. Trigger Concept

Problem:

Developer changes code:

```

Developer

     |

     v

Git Push


     |

     ?

Who starts build?

```

Solution:

Trigger

```

Git Push Event


        |

        v


Webhook


        |

        v


Trigger


        |

        v


Build Started


        |

        v


New Image Created


        |

        v


Deployment Updated


```

Triggers automate:

```
Build

Deployment

Pipeline execution

```

---

# 8. Image Registry Concept

OpenShift has internal registry.

Purpose:

```
Store container images inside cluster

```

Flow:

```

# Using External Registry

Examples:

```
Docker Hub

Quay.io

Red Hat Registry

Private Registry

```

Pull flow:

```

# 9. Why Do We Need Tekton?

Traditional approach:

```

Developer

 |

Manual Build

 |

Manual Test

 |

Manual Deployment


```

Problems:

❌ Slow

❌ Human mistakes

❌ No repeatability

# Tekton Solution

# 🧠 EX288 Memory Formula

Remember:

```

CODE

 ↓

BUILD

 ↓

IMAGE

 ↓

REGISTRY

 ↓

DEPLOYMENT

 ↓

SERVICE

 ↓

ROUTE

 ↓

USER


Automation:


TRIGGER

 ↓

TEKTON

 ↓

PIPELINE


```

# Final Instructor Note

Do not memorize commands first.

Understand the relationship:

```
GitLab
  |
  |
Build
  |
  |
Image
  |
  |
Registry
  |
  |
Deployment
  |
  |
Service
  |
  |
Route


Automation layer:

Trigger + Tekton

```

Once this flow is clear, EX288 becomes a practical engineering exam instead of a command memorization exercise.

```

---

This format is suitable for a GitHub repository as an `EX288_OpenShift_Application_Lifecycle_Guide.md` learning chapter. It also gives students the mental map before they start YAML, `oc`, `tkn`, BuildConfig, and Pipeline exercises.
```
