## Install Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) by using the web console

Configure RHOAI components by creating the "Data Science Cluster" (DSC) object.

### Solution

If you observe any issue, you can execute the below command. This lab will ensure that RHOCP is not pre-installed.
```
lab start -t AI263 rhoai-install
```


- Open a web browser: `https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp4.example.com`.
- Use the `admin` user and the password `redhatocp`.

### Install the RHOAI operator

- Click **Operators** → **OperatorHub**.
- In the **Filter by keyword** field, type `openshift ai` to locate the RHOAI operator, and then click  
  **Red Hat OpenShift AI**.
- Click **Install** to proceed to the **Install Operator** page.
- Ensure that the **stable** update channel is selected, and click **Install**.
- Wait for the RHOAI operator to finish the installation, and then click **Create** → **DatascienceCluster**.
- Go to the **YAML** view to read the DataScienceCluster custom resource definition (CRD).
- FYI: the installed components are defined as **Managed**. The removed components are not installed.
- Then, click **Create**.

### Install the Red Hat OpenShift Serverless operator

- Click **Operators** → **OperatorHub**.
- Search `serverless` to locate the **Red Hat OpenShift Serverless operator**, and then click it.

## Verify the installation

- Once it is done:
  - Click **Installed Operators**.
  - Select **Red Hat OpenShift AI**.
  - Go to **Data Science Cluster** → **default-dsc**.
  - Review the **Conditions**.

## Notes

---
**Home** → **Projects** → Search `ods` → At the bottom you will observe 4 projects:
- `redhat-ods-applications`
- `redhat-ods-monitoring`
- `redhat-ods-operator`
- `rhods-notebooks`
---

### At the end, open the RHOAI webpage from the web console itself

## How to finish the lab?
