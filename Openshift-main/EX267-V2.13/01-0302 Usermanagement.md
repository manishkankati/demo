```
oc login -u admin -p redhatocp  https://api.ocp4.example.com:6443
oc -n openshift-config get secrets htpasswd-secret -o json | jq -r '.data.htpasswd' | base64 --decode > /tmp/htpasswd-ex267.txt
htpasswd -b /tmp/htpasswd-ex267.txt suraj anishrana2001
htpasswd -b /tmp/htpasswd-ex267.txt rajan anishrana2001
htpasswd -b /tmp/htpasswd-ex267.txt punit anishrana2001
htpasswd -b /tmp/htpasswd-ex267.txt raja anishrana2001
oc -n openshift-config delete secrets htpasswd-secret 
oc -n openshift-config create secret generic htpasswd-secret --from-file htpasswd=/tmp/htpasswd-ex267.txt
```

### 📌  Create one group called `devops-wala` and this group must have `developer`, `rajan` and `punit` users.
- **These users** must able to access to the **RHOAI dashboard** but are **not administrators** or **member of any other groups**.
- Ensure that administrator access to the RHOAI dashboard is available only to `suraj` and the following users.
	- `raja`
	- Andrew
	
- Ensure that no one can access the RHOAI dashboard except `admin` users and members of the `devops-wala` group.
---


🧠 Break down the task and identify the Key goals:

1. Group `devops-wala` contains only `developer`, `rajan`, `punit`.
- Members of `devops-wala`:
	- Can access the RHOAI dashboard.
	- Are not admins.
	- Are not in any other RHOAI-relevant groups.

2. Admin access to RHOAI is only for:

- `suraj` users (existing)
- `raja`
- No one else can access the RHOAI dashboard.


### 1. Create and populate the `devops-wala` group

#### 🔹 Create the group
```
oc adm groups new devops-wala
```
####  🔹 If the group exists already, reset membership explicitly
```
oc adm groups add-users devops-wala developer rajan
oc adm groups add-users devops-wala developer punit
```

#### 🔹  Make sure *only* these are members:
```
oc get group devops-wala -o yaml
```
#### 🔹 If you find extra users in the YAML (users: list), remove them:

```
oc adm groups remove-users `devops-wala` <extra-user1>
```

#### 📦 Result: Group `devops-wala` now contains only `developer`, `rajan`, `punit`.

### 2. Create an RHOAI “user” role (non-admin)
#### 🔹 In many setups there is an existing cluster role that grants basic RHOAI dashboard access (often something like rhods-user / ods-user / similar). If your cluster already has one, reuse it; otherwise, you’d create a custom one.

#### 🔹Example if a cluster role named rhods-user already exists:

```
oc get clusterrole | grep -i rhods
```
#### 🔹 suppose you see: **rhods-user**
#### 🔹 Then bind it to the `devops-wala` group:

```
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group rhods-user `devops-wala`
```
#### 🔹 This gives dashboard access without admin privileges.
#### 🔹 If you needed to define a minimal custom cluster role, it might look like this (name: rhods-dashboard-user):

```
cat <<'EOF' | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: rhods-dashboard-user
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]  # example, adjust to RHOAI API groups
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
  # (in real clusters, you’d use the official RHOAI user role definition)
EOF
```
#### 🔹 Then:

```
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group rhods-dashboard-user `devops-wala`
```
### 3. Create an RHOAI admin role binding for `raja` and andrew
#### 🔹 Again, there is typically a built-in RHOAI admin cluster role (for example rhods-admin / ods-admin / similar). Reuse that if available:


```
oc get clusterrole | grep -i rhods
```
#### 🔹  suppose you see: rhods-admin
#### 🔹 Bind that admin role to `raja` and andrew as users, not via `devops-wala`:

```
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user rhods-admin `raja`

```
### 4. Ensure `devops-wala` members are not admins and not in other groups
#### 🔹 4.1 Remove admin roles from `devops-wala` if any
#### 🔹 If earlier bindings granted admin to the whole group, remove them:


####  🔹 Check for existing bindings mentioning `devops-wala`
```
oc get clusterrolebindings -o wide | grep `devops-wala`
```

#### 🔹For each binding that gives admin-level access (e.g., rhods-admin, cluster-admin),
#### 🔹 remove the group subject
```
oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group rhods-admin `devops-wala`
oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group cluster-admin `devops-wala`
```
#### 4.2 Ensure they aren’t in any other RHOAI groups
#### 🔹 If your environment uses other groups (e.g., rhods-users, data-scientists), check and clean:

```
oc get groups
```


## 5. **Block dashboard access** for everyone else
🔹 You want: only `suraj` + `raja` + `devops-wala` to access RHOAI.

#### 🔹Typical pattern:

#### 🔹Make sure the RHOAI dashboard is not relying on a wildcard “everyone” binding like system:authenticated → RHOAI‑user role.

#### 🔹 If such a binding exists, remove it and then explicitly bind only the groups/users you want.

5.1 Remove broad access bindings
#### 🔹Find bindings that grant RHOAI user access to system:authenticated, system:authenticated:oauth, or generic groups:

```
oc get clusterrolebindings -o wide | grep -i rhods
```
# or grep the specific RHOAI user role name
```
oc get clusterrolebindings -o wide | grep -i 'rhods-user'
```
#### 🔹 If you see something like:

#### 🔹ClusterRole: rhods-user → Group: system:authenticated

remove that binding:

```
oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group rhods-user system:authenticated
```
```
oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group rhods-user system:authenticated:oauth
```
#### 🔹Now no generic user will have RHOAI user access.
